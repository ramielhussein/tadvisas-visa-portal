      question: "What documents are required for the 2-year maid visa?",
      answer: "From the worker, we need Passport Copy, Cancellation (or entry permit if on visit visa) or Outpass (if exited during the Amnesty), clear passport quality Photo, Police Clearance Certificate for African nationalities (Excluding Ethiopia). From the Employer, Emirates ID, Ejari, & Dewa Bill. If anything else required we will contact you."

    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer my current maid's visa through TADVISAS?",
      answer: "Yes you can, but it's not a transfer, you need to cancel whatever visa you have with another provider, and provide us the required documents as above."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the entire process take?",
      answer: "Typically, 7 to 12 working days from the time we receive all required documents. This includes medical tests, government processing, and Emirates ID. We keep you updated throughout the process. In some cases, if the system rejects the application for some requirements, you will be notified of the issue and the suggested remedies."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle medical examinations and Emirates ID?",
      answer: "We will take your worker to do the medical test and the Emirates ID biometric. There will always be a medical test, but if she has a recent Emirates ID, she may be exempted from biometric stamping. Either way, you can relax as we will take care of it."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes TADVISAS different from other providers?",
      answer: "The service itself is very standard as it is a governmental service with very small room for innovation, however, removing the extra cost, adding some value added service like chauffeuring the worker is something small but can differentiate the service. Please refer to a full list of comparison https://tadvisas.com/why-us"
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a guarantee if the visa gets rejected?",

    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a Domestic Worker Center Closes down?",

Always remember these centers operate under very strict guidance from MOHRE and are monitored and almost daily."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the 2-year visa expires?",
