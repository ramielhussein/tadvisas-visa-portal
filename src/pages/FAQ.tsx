      question: "What documents are required for the 2-year maid visa?",
      answer: "From the worker, we need Passport Copy, Cancellation (or entry permit if on visit visa) or Outpass (if exited during the Amnesty), clear passport quality Photo, Police Clearance Certificate for African nationalities (Excluding Ethiopia). From the Employer, Emirates ID, Ejari, & Dewa Bill. If anything else required we will contact you."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer my current maid's visa through TADVISAS?",
      answer: "Yes you can, but it's not a transfer, you need to cancel whatever visa you have with another provider, and provide us the required documents as above."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the entire process take?",
      answer: "Typically 15-21 working days from the time we receive all required documents. This includes medical tests, government processing, and Emirates ID. We keep you updated throughout the process."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle medical examinations and Emirates ID?",
      answer: "Yes, we coordinate all medical examinations at approved centers and handle the Emirates ID application process. This is included in our service fee with no additional charges."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes TADVISAS different from other providers?",
      answer: "We charge ZERO monthly admin fees, are 100% Tadbeer licensed, offer transparent pricing, and provide complete support. Many others charge 200-500 AED monthly which adds up to thousands over 2 years."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a guarantee if the visa gets rejected?",
      answer: "We have a 99.9% approval rate due to our thorough documentation process. In the rare case of rejection due to our error, we offer a full refund. Rejections due to false information provided by clients are not covered."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I choose my domestic worker through TADVISAS?",
      answer: "Yes, we have an extensive network of qualified domestic workers from various nationalities. We can help you find the right person based on your requirements, or process the visa for someone you've already chosen."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the costs involved and are there any hidden fees?",
      answer: "Our pricing is completely transparent and varies by nationality (3,200-3,800 AED). This includes ALL government fees, medical tests, Emirates ID, and our service fee. We charge ZERO monthly admin fees unlike others."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the 2-year visa expires?",
      answer: "You can renew the visa for another 2 years through us. We'll contact you before expiry to start the renewal process. The renewal process is typically faster than the initial application."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide support after the visa is issued?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide ongoing support for any visa-related queries, renewals, and administrative needs. Our customer service team is available to help even after your visa is processed."
