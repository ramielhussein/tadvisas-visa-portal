# Phase 2: KPI Tracking System - COMPLETE âœ…

## Implementation Date
October 31, 2025

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema âœ…
**Table:** `sales_targets`
- Stores monthly/quarterly targets for sales team members
- Fields:
  - `revenue_target` - AED revenue goal
  - `deals_target` - Number of deals to close
  - `conversion_rate_target` - Lead conversion percentage goal
  - `activity_target` - Calls/emails/activities count goal
  - Period tracking (start/end dates)
  - Created by (admin who set the target)
  - Notes field for additional context

**RLS Policies:**
- Admins can manage all targets
- Users can view their own targets
- Unique constraint per user per period

### 2. KPI Calculation Logic âœ…
**Hook:** `src/hooks/useSalesKPIs.ts`
- Fetches targets from database
- Calculates actual performance:
  - **Revenue Actual:** Sum of `deals.total_amount` where status = 'Closed Won'
  - **Deals Actual:** Count of deals with status = 'Closed Won'
  - **Conversion Rate Actual:** (Converted leads / Total leads) Ã— 100
  - **Activity Actual:** Count of lead_activities (call/email/whatsapp)
- Computes progress percentages (actual/target Ã— 100)
- Supports custom date ranges or defaults to current month

### 3. UI Components âœ…

#### **KPICard** (`src/components/kpi/KPICard.tsx`)
- Reusable card displaying single KPI metric
- Shows target vs actual with progress bar
- Color-coded progress (red < 40%, yellow < 70%, blue < 100%, green â‰¥ 100%)
- Visual celebration when target is met (ðŸŽ‰)

#### **SalesKPIDashboard** (`src/components/kpi/SalesKPIDashboard.tsx`)
- Main dashboard showing all 4 KPIs in grid layout
- 4 KPI Cards:
  1. **Revenue** (AED) - Green icon
  2. **Deals Closed** (Count) - Blue icon
  3. **Conversion Rate** (%) - Purple icon
  4. **Activity Count** - Orange icon
- Loading states with skeletons
- Empty state when no targets set
- Period display (start - end dates)

#### **SetTargetsDialog** (`src/components/kpi/SetTargetsDialog.tsx`)
- Admin interface to set targets for salespeople
- Fields:
  - Period type (Monthly/Quarterly)
  - Revenue target (AED)
  - Deals target (count)
  - Conversion rate target (%)
  - Activity target (count)
  - Notes (optional)
- Auto-calculates period dates based on current month/quarter
- Upsert logic (creates or updates existing targets)

### 4. Pages Integration âœ…

#### **SalesHub** (`src/pages/hubs/SalesHub.tsx`)
- Added KPI Dashboard at the top
- Shows salesperson's own performance
- Accessible via `/hub/sales`

#### **Dashboard** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Integrated KPI Dashboard for sales users
- Shows before other dashboard widgets
- Only visible to users with sales role

#### **SalesTargets** (`src/pages/SalesTargets.tsx`) - NEW PAGE
- Admin-only page for target management
- Lists all sales team members
- Quick access to set targets for each person
- Card-based layout with user info
- Accessible via `/sales-targets`

#### **AdminHub** (`src/pages/hubs/AdminHub.tsx`)
- Added "Sales Targets" section
- Direct link to `/sales-targets` page

### 5. Routing Updates âœ…
**File:** `src/App.tsx`
- Added `/sales-targets` route
- Protected with ProtectedRoute wrapper

## How It Works

### Setting Targets (Admin Flow):
```
1. Admin navigates to /sales-targets
2. Sees list of all sales team members
3. Clicks "Set Targets" on a user card
4. Fills in target values (revenue, deals, conversion, activity)
5. Selects period type (monthly/quarterly)
6. System calculates period dates automatically
7. Targets are saved to database
```

### Viewing KPIs (Sales User Flow):
```
1. Salesperson logs in
2. Redirected to /hub/sales
3. KPI Dashboard appears at top
4. Shows 4 metrics with progress bars:
   - Revenue: AED achieved vs target
   - Deals: Count closed vs target
   - Conversion: % leads converted vs target
   - Activity: Calls/emails made vs target
5. Color-coded feedback on performance
6. Celebration when target is met
```

### KPI Calculations:

**Revenue:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_amount) 
FROM deals 
WHERE assigned_to = user_id 
  AND status = 'Closed Won'
  AND closed_at BETWEEN period_start AND period_end
```

**Deals Count:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM deals 
WHERE assigned_to = user_id 
  AND status = 'Closed Won'
  AND closed_at BETWEEN period_start AND period_end
```

**Conversion Rate:**
```sql
converted = COUNT(*) FROM leads WHERE assigned_to = user_id AND client_converted = true
total = COUNT(*) FROM leads WHERE assigned_to = user_id
rate = (converted / total) * 100
```

**Activity Count:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM lead_activities 
WHERE user_id = user_id 
  AND activity_type IN ('call', 'email', 'whatsapp')
  AND created_at BETWEEN period_start AND period_end
```

## Visual Design

### Progress Colors:
- ðŸ”´ **Red** (0-39%): Below target, needs attention
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow** (40-69%): On track but needs push
- ðŸ”µ **Blue** (70-99%): Strong performance
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green** (100%+): Target achieved! ðŸŽ‰

### KPI Icons:
- ðŸ’µ Revenue - DollarSign (green)
- ðŸŽ¯ Deals - Target (blue)
- ðŸ“ˆ Conversion - TrendingUp (purple)
- ðŸ“ž Activity - Phone (orange)

## Data Dependencies

### Required Tables:
âœ… `sales_targets` - Stores target goals
âœ… `deals` - Source for revenue and deals count
âœ… `leads` - Source for conversion rate
âœ… `lead_activities` - Source for activity count
âœ… `user_roles` - Determines who sees KPIs

## Security

âœ… **RLS Policies:**
- Salespeople can only view their own targets
- Salespeople can only see their own KPI data
- Admins can manage all targets
- Admins can view all users' KPIs

âœ… **Route Protection:**
- `/sales-targets` requires authentication
- KPI Dashboard only shows for users with sales role

## Testing Instructions

### For Admins:
1. Navigate to `/sales-targets`
2. Select a salesperson
3. Click "Set Targets"
4. Fill in all target fields
5. Save and verify success toast
6. Check database: `SELECT * FROM sales_targets WHERE user_id = '...'`

### For Sales Users:
1. Log in as salesperson
2. Should see KPI Dashboard at `/hub/sales`
3. Verify all 4 KPIs display correctly
4. Check progress bars match calculations
5. Try navigating to `/dashboard` - KPIs should show there too
6. If no targets set, should see helpful message

### Data Verification:
```sql
-- Check targets
SELECT * FROM sales_targets WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid';

-- Check deals data
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(total_amount) 
FROM deals 
WHERE assigned_to = 'user-uuid' 
  AND status = 'Closed Won'
  AND closed_at >= '2025-10-01';

-- Check conversion
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_leads,
  SUM(CASE WHEN client_converted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as converted
FROM leads 
WHERE assigned_to = 'user-uuid';

-- Check activities
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM lead_activities 
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid' 
  AND activity_type IN ('call', 'email', 'whatsapp');
```
